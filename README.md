# Google Fit - Heart & Sleep Risk Prediction
This Web Application was created as the capstone project for my college degree. It utilizes multiple concepts such as AI, Machine Learning, Web Development, Flask, API integration, and more. To use this web app, some steps will need to be followed - 

1. Create a project in <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome">Google Cloud Console</a> and set up the OAuth Consent Screen
2. Download the Client Secret file and rename it to <i>client_secret.json</i>
3. Enable Google Fit in APIs and Services
4. Download the Google Fit app on your smartwatch or mobile
5. Record your health data (Manually entering data will also work)
6. Download all required dependencies
7. Run app.py
8. And you're done!
